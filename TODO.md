 Tips for getting started:

 1. Run /init to create a CLAUDE.md file with instructions for Claude
 2. Use Claude to help with file analysis, editing, bash commands and git
 3. Be as specific as you would with another engineer for the best results
 4. ✔ Run /terminal-setup to set up terminal integration

⏺ Perplexity CLI Repository Review & Optimization Recommendations

  Summary

  This is a well-structured Python CLI tool for interacting with the Perplexity AI API. The codebase is clean, modular, and follows good Python practices. Here are my
  key findings and recommendations:

  Code Quality Assessment ✅

  - Clean Architecture: Well-organized modular structure with clear separation of concerns
  - Good Documentation: Comprehensive docstrings and type hints throughout
  - Error Handling: Proper exception handling for API calls and configuration
  - Testing: Comprehensive unit tests covering main functionality

  Key Optimization Recommendations

  1. Dependency Management & Security 🔒

  Issue: urllib3 version pinning workaround
  # Current workaround in README
  pip install urllib3==1.26.20
  Recommendation:
  - Add urllib3>=1.26.20,<2.0 to setup.py requirements
  - Remove manual workaround instructions
  - This resolves compatibility issues while maintaining security

  2. Modern Python Packaging 📦

  Current: Using setup.py + pyproject.toml hybrid
  Recommendation: Migrate to pure pyproject.toml approach:
  [project]
  name = "perplexity-cli"
  dynamic = ["version"]
  dependencies = ["requests>=2.25.0", "urllib3>=1.26.20,<2.0"]

  3. Configuration Improvements ⚙️

  Current: Basic ConfigParser usage
  Enhancements:
  - Add XDG Base Directory support for cross-platform config
  - Support YAML/JSON config formats
  - Add config validation schema

  4. Performance Optimizations ⚡

  - Connection Pooling: Use requests.Session() for API calls (reuses connections)
  - Async Support: Consider aiohttp for concurrent requests
  - Response Caching: Cache model lists locally with TTL

  5. CLI/UX Enhancements 🎯

  - Rich Terminal Output: Add rich library for better formatting
  - Interactive Mode: Add prompt-based interface for repeated queries
  - Stream Responses: Support streaming for long responses
  - Shell Completion: Add bash/zsh completion scripts

  6. Development Workflow 🔧

  Missing:
  - GitHub Actions CI/CD
  - Pre-commit hooks
  - Automated releases
  - Code coverage reporting

  Recommendation: Add .github/workflows/ci.yml:
  name: CI
  on: [push, pull_request]
  jobs:
    test:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        - uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        - run: pip install -e ".[dev]"
        - run: pytest --cov=perplexity_cli

  7. Error Handling & Logging 📝

  Enhancements:
  - Structured logging with JSON output option
  - Retry logic with exponential backoff for API calls
  - Better error messages for common issues (invalid API key, network errors)

  8. Security Hardening 🛡️

  Current: Basic file permissions (0o600) for config
  Enhancements:
  - API key validation on startup
  - Support for encrypted config files
  - Environment variable validation
  - Rate limiting awareness

  Priority Implementation Order

  1. High Priority: Dependency management fix (urllib3)
  2. High Priority: Performance optimizations (connection pooling)
  3. Medium Priority: Modern packaging migration
  4. Medium Priority: CI/CD setup
  5. Low Priority: Rich terminal output and interactive features

  Code Metrics

  - Total Lines: ~880 (concise and focused)
  - Test Coverage: Good unit test coverage for core functionality
  - Dependencies: Minimal (only requests required)
  - Python Compatibility: 3.7+ (consider bumping to 3.8+ for modern features)

  Overall Assessment

  This is a solid, production-ready CLI tool with good architecture. The main improvements are around modern Python practices, performance optimizations, and developer
  experience enhancements. The codebase shows good engineering practices and is well-maintained.
